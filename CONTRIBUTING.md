# Contributing

Thank you for the interest in contributing!
We want to improve the codebase so that it's usable for others too, so we are very open for PRs and issues.
The docs has a page about architecture details to help you understand the codebase.

Before starting on a bigger change it might be a good idea to create an issue about your ideas so that we can help you out and become aligned.
